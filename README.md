## Imaging

### Camera
- A camera is any device capable of collecting light rays coming from a scene and recording an image of it
	- Sensor used can either be digital (CCD, CMOS) or analog (film)
- The term camera is derived from the Latin term *camera obscura* which translates to "dark room"

### Imaging Concept
- The optical system captures focuses light rays from 1 scene point to converge at 1 point of the screen
- The screen captures the image through photoreceptors on the screen
	- Photoreceptors can come in the form of retina receptor cells, camera film, CCD and CMOS
- Aperture controls the amount of light rays entering the device

### Human Visual System
- Optical system is represented by the lens in our eyes
	- Controlled by eye muscles when focusing
- Screen is represented by the retina in our eyes
	- $10^8$ receptor cells on retina
	- Receptor cells come in the form of rods (grayscale sensitive) and cones (colour sensitive)
	- Optic nerve sends light information to visual cortex in the brain
- Aperture is represented by the pupils in the iris
	- Adjust automatically according to amount of light entering the eye

## Geometry in Image Formation

### Thin Lens 
- Can be modelled by a simple thin lens
- Thin lens has 2 spherical surfaces close to each other and is ideal for point-to-point imaging 
- Unideal imaging is called abberation
- Properties 
	- All rays entering lens parallel to optical axis will pass through the focal point on the opposite side (basic property)
	- All rays entering lens through the focal point on its way to the lens will exit the lens parallel to the optical axis (symmetry property)
	- All rays entering the lens center will pass straight through the lens, these rays are known as principal rays (consequent property)
- Fundemental equations
