## Imaging

### Imaging Systems

-   Imaging is about capturing a scene's shape (geometry) and brightness (radiometry) to create a 2D representation

#### Basic Components

-   Optical system: focuses light rays from a scene point to converge on one point (lens in camera or eye)
-   Screen: captures light via photoreceptors (retina in eyes, CCD/CMOS in cameras)
-   Aperture: controls light intake (pupil in eyes, adjustable in camera lens)

#### Human Visual System

-   Lens focuses light and is adjusted by muscles
-   Retina has rods for to percieve black/white and cones to perceive color, signals are sent via optic nerve to brain
-   Iris and pupil adjusts automatically, small in bright light and large in dark

#### Digital Cameras

-   Use lenses, sensors and apertures

### Geometric Image Formation

-   Light rays from objects pass through a lens to form an inverted image on the sensor plane

#### Thin Lens Model

-   Can be modelled by a simple thin lens
-   Thin lens has 2 spherical surfaces close to each other and is ideal for point-to-point imaging
-   Unideal imaging is called abberation
-   Properties
    -   All rays entering lens parallel to optical axis will pass through the focal point on the opposite side (basic property)
    -   All rays entering lens through the focal point on its way to the lens will exit the lens parallel to the optical axis (symmetry property)
    -   All rays entering the lens center will pass straight through the lens, these rays are known as principal rays (consequent property)
-   Lens equations
    -   $\frac{1}{\hat{Z}} + \frac{1}{\hat{z}} = \frac{1}{f}$
        -   $\hat{Z}$ is the distance from object to lens
        -   $\hat{z}$ is the distance from lens to image
        -   $f$ is the focal distance of the lens
-   Magnification equations
    -   $\frac{X}{\hat{Z}} = \frac{x}{\hat{z}}$ and $\frac{Y}{\hat{Z}} = \frac{y}{\hat{z}}$
        -   (X, Y) are coordinates of a point in the object plane
        -   (x, y) are corresponding coordinates in the image plane

#### Depth of Field

-   Refers to the range of depths that scene objects can be at for acceptance imaging
-   Mainly affected by aperture
    -   Smaller aperture will result in larger depth of field
    -   Larger aperture will result in smaller depth of field

### Radiometric Image Formation

-   Deals with brightness/intensity
-   Full model involves light sources, object reflectance, lens collection and sensor response
-   A simplified model is $f(x, y) = i(x, y) \times r(x, y)$
    -   $f(x, y)$ is the image intensity
    -   $i(x, y)$ is the illumination function due to light sources
    -   $r(x, y)$ is the reflectance function due to object shape and albedo

### Digital Image Representation

#### Charge Coupled Device (CCD) Array

-   2D array of photo-diodes
-   Voltage at diodes proportional to image exposure
    -   Exposure = irradiance $\times$ time
    -   Time is the interval that the shutter is open
-   Color is being generated by the Bayer mosaic
    -   B, G, G, R layout
    -   Human eyes are more sensitive to green colour, hence 2 of them present

#### Spatial Sampling

-   Making it discrete
-   Smaller intervals result in higher pixel resolution

#### Quantization

-   Making it digital
-   For digital representation, diode voltages need to be quantized into discrete levels
-   More levels would mean greater dynamic resolution

#### Image as a Function or Matrix

-   For grayscale images, image intensity is often expressed as a scalar function $f(x, y)$
    -   Can also be viewed as a 2D matrix
-   For color images, it is a vector of three functions $r(x, y)$, $g(x, y)$, $b(x, y)$
    -   Can be viewed as 3D matrix

#### Image Filed Formats

-   GIF is a common 8-bit color indexing and lossless compression format used for web art
-   TIFF is traditionally used for scanned documents, may or may not be compressed
-   PNG is a newer lossless compressed format capable of handling 24-bit images
-   JPEG is a common lossy compression format based on Discrete Cosine Transform (DCT) capable of achieving high compression ratios
-   JPEG2000 is the latest lossy compression format based on Wavelet Transforms
