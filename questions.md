A lens changes the light ray by:

-   [ ] Diffraction
-   [x] Refraction
-   [ ] Reflection
-   [ ] Scattering

Human eyes perform the above function most obviously by:

-   [] Lens
-   [x] Cornea
-   [ ] Retina
-   [ ] Optical nerve

Light bends as it passes from one medium to another with a different refractive index (e.g., from air to water or air to glass)

Since an imaging system mimics our human eyes, it performs \_\_\_ human eyes:

-   [ ] Better than
-   [ ] Worse than
-   [x] Hard to say

Human eyes are adaptive and flexible, but cannot see tiny objects which requrie the use of devices like microscopes

What are the two basic requirements of qualified imaging?

-   [ ] Colorful and artistic
-   [x] A similar shape
-   [ ] Bright
-   [x] A similar brightness

From a 2D image, somehow we still feel the depth because of:

-   [x] DOF
-   [x] Person/object/scene size
-   [x] Occlusion
-   [x] Motion
-   [x] Story/experience

How to get full 3D information, possibly?

-   [x] Based on the lens’ basic equation
-   [x] Time of flight of the light
-   [x] Two cameras
-   [x] Structured light projection

Is the 3D movie necessary?

-   [x] Yes
-   [x] No

We can now get an image. In the 2D space (the screen), this image is

-   [x] continuous
-   [ ] discrete
-   [ ] digital

Assuming object space (physical)

For the brightness, this image is

-   [x] continuous
-   [ ] discrete
-   [ ] digital

Assuming object space (physical)

What does an image look like in your phone/computer?

-   [ ] Vivid pictures
-   [ ] Symbols
-   [ ] Real numbers
-   [x] Integer numbers

The file size of a picture (1K×1K=1M pixels) is about

-   [x] <1MB
-   [x] =1MB
-   [x] =3MB
-   [x] > 3MB

<1MB when compressed, 1MB when not compressed, 3MB when color image, >3MB when transparency channel is used or industrial cameras with more bits

A picture may not be up to your expectation because of

-   [x] Too low/high intensity
-   [x] Noise
-   [x] Motion/shaking blur
-   [x] Unwanted objects/persons

Point processing is of course “point-wise” and thus not global.

-   [ ] Yes
-   [x] No

The purpose of point processing is

-   [x] Increase content information
-   [x] Increase perception comfort
-   [x] Scientific operation
-   [ ] nonsense

In power law transformation, c is

-   [ ] 1
-   [ ] L-1
-   [x] (L-1)^(1-γ)
-   [ ] (L-1)^(-γ)

After histogram equalization, the largest value (L-1) in the original image becomes

-   [ ] L-2
-   [x] L-1
-   [ ] L
-   [ ] Others

Can spatial filtering remove noise?

-   [x] Yes
-   [ ] No

Can spatial filtering find image features?

-   [x] Yes
-   [ ] No

Correlation and convolution are

-   [ ] same
-   [x] different

Image padding can be done by

-   [x] Adding zeros
-   [x] Data extension
-   [x] Data mirroring

Three pixels have the same signal intensity. Their average value is

-   [ ] Smaller
-   [x] Same
-   [ ] Larger

Three pixels have random values, each obeying Gaussian distribution with the same mean and standard deviation. The average value' mean is

-   [ ] Smaller
-   [x] Same
-   [ ] Larger

The above average value's standard deviation is

-   [x] Smaller
-   [ ] Same
-   [ ] Larger

Is the spatial averaging only applicable to neighboring pixels?

-   [ ] Yes
-   [x] No
